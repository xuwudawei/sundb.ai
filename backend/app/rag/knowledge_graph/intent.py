    1. Dependency Analysis:

        - Analyze the user's query to identify the underlying dependencies and relationships between different components.
        - Construct a dependency graph that visually represents these relationships.

    2. Question Breakdown: Divide the query into a sequence of step-by-step questions necessary to address the main query comprehensively.

    3. Provide Reasoning: Explain the rationale behind each question.

    4. Constraints:
        - Limit the output to no more than 5 questions to maintain focus and relevance.
        - Ensure accuracy by reflecting the user's true intentions based on the provided query.
        - Ground all questions in factual information derived directly from the user's input.
