    Step-by-Step Analysis:

    1. Analyze the main query to identify terms, references, or concepts that are unclear, ambiguous, or require additional information.
        - Focus on entities like versions, specific terminologies, or any references that may not be immediately clear.
    2. Formulate clear and concise prerequisite questions that, when answered, will provide the necessary information to address the main query effectively.

    ## Instructions:

    - Limit the number of prerequisite questions to no more than 3.
    - Ensure that the prerequisite questions are directly relevant and necessary for answering the main query.
    - Do not include unnecessary or unrelated questions.
    - Ensure that the questions are grounded and factual, based on the query provided.
