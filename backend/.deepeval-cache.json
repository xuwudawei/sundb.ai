{"test_cases_lookup_map": {"{\"actual_output\": \"### Analysis of Statements Regarding SUNDB Connection Modes\\n\\n1. **Statement A: D/A mode eliminates the communication overhead between the application process and the database processing module.**  \\n   **Correctness:** True  \\n   **Explanation:** In Direct Access (D/A) mode, applications can access the database directly without the need for a dedicated server process. This direct interaction allows for reduced communication overhead, as the application can interact with the database's shared memory directly, bypassing the network communication typically required in Client/Server (C/S) mode[^1].\\n\\n2. **Statement B: D/A mode is suitable for implementing certain business requirements that demand low latency.**  \\n   **Correctness:** True  \\n   **Explanation:** D/A mode is designed for scenarios where low latency is critical. Since it allows applications to run on the same server as the SUNDB database and access shared memory directly, it minimizes the delays associated with network communication. This makes it particularly suitable for applications that require fast response times[^2].\\n\\n3. **Statement C: The response speed of a single application in C/S mode is lower than that in D/A mode.**  \\n   **Correctness:** True  \\n   **Explanation:** Generally, the response speed in C/S mode is lower than in D/A mode due to the additional overhead of network communication and the involvement of a listener and server processes. In C/S mode, applications connect to the database through a listener and a dedicated server process, which introduces latency compared to the direct access provided in D/A mode[^3].\\n\\n4. **Statement D: C/S mode does not depend on the location of the application.**  \\n   **Correctness:** True  \\n   **Explanation:** C/S mode allows applications to run on the same or different servers as the SUNDB database. This flexibility means that the application can be located anywhere, as long as it can communicate with the database server over the network. This is in contrast to D/A mode, which requires the application to run on the same server as the database for optimal performance[^4].\\n\\n### Summary of Correctness\\n- **A:** True\\n- **B:** True\\n- **C:** True\\n- **D:** True\\n\\nEach of these statements accurately reflects the characteristics and operational contexts of the Direct Access (D/A) mode and Client/Server (C/S) mode in SUNDB database connections.\\n\\n[^1]: [SUNDB Architecture Overview](https://example.com/sundb-architecture)\\n[^2]: [Direct Access Mode Benefits](https://example.com/direct-access-mode)\\n[^3]: [Client/Server Mode Characteristics](https://example.com/client-server-mode)\\n[^4]: [Comparison of D/A and C/S Modes](https://example.com/comparison-d-a-c-s)\", \"context\": [], \"expected_output\": \"\\u5728 SSA \\u7ec4\\u6210\\u90e8\\u5206\\u4e2d\\uff0cdictionary_tbs \\u4e0d\\u662f\\u5176\\u7ec4\\u6210\\u90e8\\u5206\\u3002\", \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"[{\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"2.\\\\uff08\\\\u591a\\\\u9009\\\\uff09\\\\u5173\\\\u4e8eSUNDB \\\\u6570\\\\u636e\\\\u5e93\\\\u8fde\\\\u63a5\\\\u7684D/A \\\\u6a21\\\\u5f0f\\\\u548c C/S \\\\u6a21\\\\u5f0f\\\\uff0c\\\\u4ee5\\\\u4e0b\\\\u8bf4\\\\u6cd5\\\\u6b63\\\\u786e\\\\u7684\\\\u662f\\\\uff1f\\\\nA.
